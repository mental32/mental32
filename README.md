About Me:

Software Engineer, Networking Enthusiast, Git Geek.

I value clean, efficient, software design. Python, C, Go, Rust, etc...

I like working on: networking topics (e.g. BGP, SD-WAN, NFV), distributed systems, and high-frequency trading systems.

While my GitHub hosts several of my side projects, much of my professional work remains proprietary or private, I use Github to graveyard old side-projects.

You can reach me by email at `mentalfoss@gmail`
