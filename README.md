<hr>

Software Engineer, Networking Enthusiast, Git Geek.

I value clean, efficient, software design. Python, C, Rust, etc...

I like working on: networking topics (e.g. BGP, SD-WAN, NFV), distributed systems, and high-frequency trading systems.

[Github is not my CV.](https://blog.jcoglan.com/2013/11/15/why-github-is-not-your-cv/) The majority of my work happens privately now, I use Github to graveyard old side-projects.

You can reach me by email at `mentalfoss@gmail`
